# Express Server

This is a TypeScript-based Express server skeleton that can be used as a starting point for new projects. It includes a basic middleware setup, routing, and error handling.

## Overview

This server is built with TypeScript and Express, providing a robust and scalable structure for building RESTful APIs. It includes essential middleware for parsing cookies, handling CORS, logging HTTP requests, and managing errors. The server also supports environment variable configuration using `dotenv`.

## Features

- TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
- Basic middleware setup (cookie parser, CORS, logging)
- Environment variable configuration with `dotenv`
- Error handling
- Development and production scripts

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v22.13.1 or higher)
- npm (11.1.0 or higher)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/BradleyParkerDev/express-server.git
    cd express-server
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables. For example:**

    ```env
    PORT=3001
    ```

4. **Build the project:**

    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

5. **Run the server in development mode with hot-reloading:**

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

6. **Run the server in production mode:**

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
